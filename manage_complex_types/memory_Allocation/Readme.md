# Memory Allocation and Management in Go

In Go, memory allocation and management are handled by the Go runtime, which operates in the background on dedicated threads. Similar to other managed languages like Java and C#, you don't have to explicitly allocate or deallocate memory in your code; it is all managed for you.

When using complex types such as maps (collections of key-value pairs), it is important to initialize them correctly. Go provides two built-in functions for this: make() and new(). These functions are used to initialize complex objects, but there is a difference between them.

The new() function allocates memory but does not initialize it. When you allocate an object using new(), you receive a memory address indicating the location of the object. However, the object itself has zeroed memory storage. If you try to add key-value pairs to the object, it will result in an error.

On the other hand, the make() function both allocates and initializes memory. When you use make(), you receive a memory address just like with new(), but the storage is non-zero and ready to accept values.

Here's an example to illustrate the difference:

```go
 
// Using `new()` - Allocates but does not initialize memory
M := new(map[string]int)
M["theAnswer"] = 42 // Causes an error

// Using `make()` - Allocates and initializes memory
M := make(map[string]int)
M["theAnswer"] = 42 // Works fine
```

It is crucial to wrap the declaration of complex objects in the make() function if you intend to immediately add data to the object.

In Go, memory deallocation is handled automatically by the garbage collector, which is built into the Go runtime. The garbage collector runs in the background and periodically looks for objects that are out of scope or set to nil to reclaim memory and return it to the memory pool.

The garbage collector in Go was rebuilt in Go 1.5 to minimize pauses and reduce latency when running Go applications. The process of deallocating memory is very fast and unlikely to be noticeable, even on slower computers.

That covers the basics of memory allocation and management in Go. The Go runtime takes care of memory management for you, allowing you to focus on writing your code.
