# Program Conditional Logic
In Go, the syntax for the if statement is similar to C or Java, but it does not require parentheses around the Boolean condition.

Let's start by creating a variable named answer and assigning it a value of 42. We'll also declare a string variable named result without an initial value.

 ```go
answer := 42
var result string
 ```

Next, we can use the if statement with Boolean conditions, followed by braces to define the code block. In Go, we don't need parentheses around the condition.

 ```go
if answer < 0 {
    result = "less than zero"
} else if answer == 0 {
    result = "equal to zero"
} else {
    result = "greater than zero"
}
 ```

Finally, we can use the fmt.Println function to output the result variable.

 ```go
fmt.Println(result)
 ```

Note that in Go, the opening brace of a code block must be on the same line as the preceding statement. If you place it on the next line, it will result in an error.

Additionally, Go's if statement allows for including an initial statement that is part of the condition. This can be useful for initializing variables.

 ```go
if x := -42; x < 0 {
    result = "less than zero"
} else if x == 0 {
    result = "equal to zero"
} else {
    result = "greater than zero"
}
 ```

You can then use the fmt.Println function again to output the result variable.

 ```go
fmt.Println(result)
 ``` 

That covers the basics of using conditional logic with if, elseif, and else statements in Go. Remember, the syntax is similar to C and Java, but without the need for parentheses around the Boolean conditions.
